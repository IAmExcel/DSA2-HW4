# Data Structures and Algorithms Homework Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to homework assignments for a Data Structures and Algorithms course. Each program is a standalone example of a specific algorithm or concept in practice.

## Homework Assignments

### Question 1: Bucket Sort with Insertion Sort
In this program, I've implemented a bucket sort algorithm, which uses insertion sort to sort individual buckets. The program generates 100 random numbers and sorts them using this combined approach.

- [BucketInsertionSort.cpp](/BucketInsertionSort.cpp)

### Question 2: Dijkstra's Algorithm
The second program is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

- [DijkstrasAlgorithm.cpp](/DijkstrasAlgorithm.cpp)

### Question 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
The third program solves the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem using a dynamic programming approach. It includes detailed comments explaining the base case and recursive case of the algorithm.

- [LongestIncreasingSubsequence.cpp](/LongestIncreasingSubsequence.cpp)

## Building and Running

Each program is written in C++ and can be compiled with any standard C++ compiler like g++.
